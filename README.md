# Battleship AI

## Group project in the course TNM095 - Artificial Intelligence for Interactive Media

This is an AI agent for solving the game Battleship. It's based on a neural networks model which predicts the likelyhood of a position being occupied by a ship. The NN model can be used in an online game to play against. The agent does not consider the opponents moves.
